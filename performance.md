# Performance & Responsiveness Effort Estimate (as of May 8, 2025)

## Blockchain Throughput: 100 Million Transactions Per Second (TPS)

### Current State

- The current architecture is based on Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity) and a React.js frontend.
- Public blockchains like Ethereum mainnet are limited to ~15-100 TPS; even Layer 2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync) reach thousands of TPS at best.
- Achieving 100 million TPS is far beyond current public blockchain technology and would require a fundamentally new architecture (custom Layer 1, sharded or DAG-based blockchain, or massive off-chain batching/rollups, possibly with global distributed consensus and hardware acceleration).

### Effort Estimate

- **Research and Architecture Design:** 40 days
- **Custom Blockchain/Layer 1 or Massive Layer 2 Rollup Integration:** 240 days
- **Smart Contract Redesign for Extreme Parallelism and Off-chain Processing:** 80 days
- **Testing, Benchmarking, and Optimization:** 60 days
- **DevOps/Infrastructure for Ultra-High-Throughput Nodes:** 40 days
- **Total Estimate:** 460 days (at 4 hours/day, with buffer)

> **Note:** This is a theoretical estimate. Achieving 100M TPS would require a dedicated protocol R&D team, hardware specialists, and likely years of research and development.

## Frontend Framework Responsiveness

### Current State

- The frontend uses React.js with functional components and TailwindCSS.
- UI is responsive and accessible, but further optimization is possible for high-frequency updates and large data sets.

### Areas for Improvement

- Virtualized lists for large campaign/result sets
- Debounced and throttled event handlers
- Optimized state management (consider React Query, Zustand, or Redux Toolkit)
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized image and asset delivery (CDN, next-gen formats)
- Accessibility and animation performance

### Effort Estimate

_All estimates below assume 4 hours of focused work per day._

- **Audit and Benchmarking:** 4 days
- **Implement Virtualization, Debouncing, and State Optimization:** 8 days
- **Code Splitting, Asset Optimization, and Lazy Loading:** 4 days
- **Accessibility and Animation Tuning:** 4 days
- **Total Estimate:** 20 days (at 4 hours/day, with buffer)

## Frontend Framework Migration

### Overview

- Migrating the frontend from React.js to a modern framework (e.g., Next.js, Vue, Svelte) can improve maintainability, performance, and scalability.
- Migration involves codebase analysis, component refactoring, state management adaptation, routing changes, and integration with existing backend/smart contracts.

### Effort Estimate

_All estimates below assume 4 hours of focused work per day._

- **Codebase Audit & Migration Planning:** 4 days
- **Component & Page Migration:** 16 days
- **State Management & Data Fetching Adaptation:** 6 days
- **Routing, Asset, and Style Migration:** 4 days
- **Testing & Bug Fixes:** 6 days
- **Documentation & Developer Onboarding:** 4 days
- **Total Estimate:** 40 days (at 4 hours/day, with buffer)

## Summary Table

| Task                                                       | Estimated Time (days at 4 hours/day) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Blockchain throughput to 100M TPS (theoretical)            | 460                                  |
| Frontend responsiveness (highly responsive UI)             | 30                                   |
| Frontend framework migration (React.js â†’ modern framework) | 70                                   |

---

**Total (with buffer):** 520 days (at 4 hours/day)

> **Disclaimer:** 100M TPS is far beyond the scope of current public blockchain tech and would require protocol-level and hardware innovation. Frontend responsiveness improvements are practical and can be achieved with focused effort.
